      The lesson shows each word one time and then randomly shows the words. That means sometimes the same word will show up again. After a set number of times based on the number of words, a check mark will appear and you can end that part of the exercise if you are ready. It will then show the words beginning with a capital letter and will talk about each word, often using it in a sentence for clarity.

      I have made some slight edits to the McGuffey Primer, mostly to modernize it, just a little. Instead of liking to watch the boys at play, the girls like to play too! Several names have changed as well. The name Ann changed to Anna, not to modernize it, but just because it's hard for little ones to say and hear the difference between Ann and "and" which both appear in just the second lesson.
